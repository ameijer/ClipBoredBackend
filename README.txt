#README

This is a simple appengine project I wrote back in undergrad, with @bamj001. It aggregates videos from 
outside sources and presents them to the user in succession, in a manner similar to clip shows on TV. 
We called it Clipbored. 

You can find the client for this server on his github @ https://github.com/bamj001/ClipBoredApp
